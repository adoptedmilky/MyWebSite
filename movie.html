        <p>Where do I even begin? Attack on Titan is so intruiging, twisted, philosophical, depressing, and contains so many unsettling details that make you ponder about the nature of humanity. This whole anime has been a traumatizing and bittersweet coaster ride. I couln't get over the ending for a month :C.  </p>
