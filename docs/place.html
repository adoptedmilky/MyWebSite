        <h2>New York City </h2>
        <p>The bustling streets, the rows of grand skyscrappers,the feeling that you have unlimited potential in the center of the world, all in none other than the never-resting livelihood of New York City. This is the over-romantizced city that remains the dreams of many. I love the diverse cultures in New York and how much it embodies a "mixing pot" of ethnic cusines. I hold dear to myself the feeling of being completely surrouded by crowds at every corner yet knowing that you are completely free of judgement.</p>
