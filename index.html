        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>I consider myself a professional chef and exotic food conoisseur. Enjoying authetic cusine in a resturat is fulfilling, but the satisfaction I obtain from preparing food with my own hands is priceless. Being able to prepare fresh ingredients, watch them boil in the perfect combination of flavors, and precisely measure the time it takes to cook each ingredient is a stress relieving experience.  The best part, you get to dig in on your comfort food right after it's done! </p> 
        <h2>Film</h2> 
        <p>I really enjoy capturing the little insignificant moments in life with film. There is so much beauty in life that we take for grated(physical and invisible). Not only does film allow me to appreciate what mother nature has provided us, but also the little joyous moments that we look back at with a warm and fuzzy sense of nostalgia.</p>
